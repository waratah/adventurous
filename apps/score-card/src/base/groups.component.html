  <h2>Overview of the system</h2>
  <p>
    This system allows you to produce the PDF required by Scouts NSW. If possible it allows questions to be answered once, like your first
    aid certificate. Just because you have completed and been verified by this system does not mean you have completed the qualification.
    You must submit the application to
    <a href="https://nswscouts.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/group/11/create/36">Scouts NSW Activities Training</a>
  </p>
  <p>You must complete the Adventurous Log book with all your activities.  Get your copy here: <button mat-button (click)="getLog()">Template log (Excel)</button> </p>
  <p>
    It is not meant as a pixel perfect example of the PDF. Some questions are changed to allow it to be entered into the simple data system
    this application uses
  </p>
  <p>
    The bars on the sections are coloured depending on the level. These colours echo Cubs (Safe Participant), Scouts (Trained Participant),
    Venturers (Assistant Guide) and Rovers (Guide).
  </p>
  <p>There are also region specific training which is in draft. Stay tuned on advances in the scouting approval system.</p>
